# Q-SYS Lua Language Definitions

Welcome to this repository of language definitions for Lua, designed specifically for use with Q-Sys systems. This collection provides completion, diagnostics, typing and more for Q-Sys.

### Purpose
This project aims to create a comprehensive library of Lua code that can be used with your favorite text editor to make development on the Q-Sys platform much better!

This repo was actually made as part of the [qplug](github.com/kcx1/qplug) project, and it's purpose will continue to serve as a vital dependency of that project. However, I see value in having this be it's own repository.

### Features
- A comprehensive collection of language definitions for all documented Q-Sys library functions and methods
- Modular design allowing for easy extension and modification as the Q-Sys Lua Library evolves

### Getting Started
Make sure that you're using [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io/)

To get started, you can simply clone this floder into the root of your project. However, you can also configure your favorite text editor to use these definitions globally by setting the `workspace.library`. That way you don't have to keep definition files in your plugin repo.

To learn more check out the [luals docs](https://luals.github.io/wiki/configuration/)
